[This is the first post](/blog/welcome) of the blog!

Now would be a great time for me to declare a manifesto, but I simply do not have one. Other than bringing back the indie web and sticking to FOSS, there is little in terms of online activism in my life.

This blog will be home to my tutorials and essays. I will predominately be covering tech projects that I have completed, and the mistakes I made along the way. My goal here on the blog is for you to learn something in an efficient, detailed, and concise manner. Understand the costly and time consuming mistakes that I have made so that you can avoid them in your own endeavors.

Interested in keeping up with me?
